# cat ABOUTME.md

Welcome to my Warp Portfolio! My name is **Klender Carrasco**.

I'm a Systems Engineer, entrepreneur, and tech lover, recently graduated with a Master's Degree in Software Engineering and IT Systems.

I currently work as a Senior Frontend Developer at the Consejo Nacional Electoral, a public institution in charge of organizing electoral processes in Ecuador. With over 8 years of experience in software development, I am passionate about building high-quality, scalable applications.

My career began as a Full Stack Developer (co-founding my own agency, iLinser), which gave me a complete perspective on the entire product lifecycle. Today, my specialty is the Frontend, where I focus on React, TypeScript, and TDD.

My priority is always to deliver the best possible user experience, with a sharp focus on accessibility, performance, and pixel-perfect attention to detail.
